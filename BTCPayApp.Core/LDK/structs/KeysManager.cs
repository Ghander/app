 * Your `node_id` is seed/0'.
 * Unilateral closes may use seed/1'.
 * Cooperative closes may use seed/2'.
 * The two close keys may be needed to claim on-chain funds!
 * 
 * This struct cannot be used for nodes that wish to support receiving phantom payments;
 * [`PhantomKeysManager`] must be used instead.

 * Note that switching between this struct and [`PhantomKeysManager`] will invalidate any
 * previously issued invoices and attempts to pay previous invoices will fail.

	 * Constructs a [`KeysManager`] from a 32-byte seed. If the seed is in some way biased (e.g.,
	 * your CSRNG is busted) this may panic (but more importantly, you will possibly lose funds).
	 * `starting_time` isn't strictly required to actually be a time, but it must absolutely,
	 * without a doubt, be unique to this instance. ie if you start multiple times with the same
	 * `seed`, `starting_time` must be unique to each run. Thus, the easiest way to achieve this
	 * is to simply use the current time (with very high precision).
	 * 
	 * The `seed` MUST be backed up safely prior to use so that the keys can be re-created, however,
	 * obviously, `starting_time` should be unique every time you reload the library - it is only
	 * used to generate new ephemeral key data (which will be stored by the individual channel if
	 * necessary).
	 * 
	 * Note that the seed is required to recover certain on-chain funds independent of
	 * [`ChannelMonitor`] data, though a current copy of [`ChannelMonitor`] data is also required
	 * for any channel, and some on-chain during-closing funds.
