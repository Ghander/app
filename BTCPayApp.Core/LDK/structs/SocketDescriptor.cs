 * implement Hash to meet the PeerManager API.
 * 
 * For efficiency, Clone should be relatively cheap for this type.
 * 
 * Two descriptors may compare equal (by [`cmp::Eq`] and [`hash::Hash`]) as long as the original
 * has been disconnected, the [`PeerManager`] has been informed of the disconnection (either by it
 * having triggered the disconnection or a call to [`PeerManager::socket_disconnected`]), and no
 * further calls to the [`PeerManager`] related to the original socket occur. This allows you to
 * use a file descriptor for your SocketDescriptor directly, however for simplicity you may wish
 * to simply use another value which is guaranteed to be globally unique instead.
